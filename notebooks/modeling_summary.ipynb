    "As our response variable is categorical, we will test different classification models paying special attention to the ensemble methods that tend to perform better in problems similar to ours. Since we have more than a 100 features to predict our response variable, dimensionality reduction techniques might be relevant to improve the models' accuracy."

Among the different ensemble methods, Bagging (using Decision Trees) showed stronger results than Boosting and Random Forests.
